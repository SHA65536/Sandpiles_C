## About The Project

**A simple visualization for a sandpiles algorithm.**
<br>
Each square on screen represents a value from 0-7, each frame the center square gets incremented by 1. When a cell goes above 7, it will topple down in a knight's chess pattern and raise those cells by 1/8th of it's value.
